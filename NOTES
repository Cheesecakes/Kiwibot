 o last-seen plugin has a bug where if a user is connected to the
channel and then we say !seen <user>, we get the date they last
disconnected. The bot should say something like "They are connected
right now!" or something.

o Users should be able to talk to the kiwi in private chat with normal
commands (e.g. <botname>: help). Currently this isn't handled.

o If there is no save file when the bot is started, it should be
created for the user (lua file errors are thrown otherwise).
