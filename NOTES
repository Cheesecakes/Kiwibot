 o last-seen plugin has a bug where if a user is connected to the
channel and then we say !seen <user>, we get the date they last
disconnected. The bot should say something like "They are connected
right now!" or something. ***** Note that we already store a list of
connected users in the c++, all that we have to do is look up that
list and see if the user is in it. Not sure if this works corectly for
nick changes, PARTs and QUITs though...
